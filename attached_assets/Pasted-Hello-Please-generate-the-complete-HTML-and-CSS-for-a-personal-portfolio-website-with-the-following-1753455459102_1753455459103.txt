Hello! Please generate the complete HTML and CSS for a personal portfolio website with the following specifications:

1.  Overall Goal & Style:
* The user is a final-year B.Tech Computer Science student at MPGI, Kanpur.
* The website should have a modern, clean, and "minimal tech geek" appearance.
* It must be a single-page layout and fully responsive for mobile devices.

2.  Color Scheme (The "Amethyst Night" Theme):
* Background: A deep, dark indigo (#161625).
* Primary/Accent Color: A vibrant amethyst purple (#8b5cf6).
* Text Color: A soft, light lavender-grey (#c7c7d2).
* Card Backgrounds: A dark slate purple (#1e1e32) to distinguish them from the main background.
* Headings: Pure white (#ffffff).

3.  Website Structure & Sections:
* Navbar: A fixed-top navbar that is slightly transparent. It should have links to "About", "Projects", "Contact", and a highlighted button for "My Resume".
* Hero Section: A clean, bold section with my Name, my Tagline (e.g., "Final Year B.Tech Student | Aspiring Developer"), and a call-to-action button "View My Work".
* About Me Section: A section with a space for a professional photo (circular), a short bio, and a list of my technical skills displayed as badges (e.g., Java, Python, React, SQL).
* Projects Section: This is a critical section.
* Create a grid of 3 project cards.
* Each card should have a placeholder for an image, a project title, a short description, badges for the technologies used, and two buttons: "GitHub" and "Live Demo".
* The cards should have a subtle hover effect, like lifting up slightly and glowing with the primary purple color.
* Contact Section: A simple section with a "Get In Touch" heading and large, clickable icons for Email, GitHub, and LinkedIn.
* Footer: A simple footer with my name and the current year.

4.  CSS Implementation:
* Please generate all the CSS in a separate style.css file.
* Use CSS variables (:root) to define the color palette for easy modification.
* Use modern CSS properties like backdrop-filter for the navbar transparency and transition for smooth hover effects.
